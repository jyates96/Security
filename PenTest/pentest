## Week 16 Homework Submission File: Penetration Testing 1

#### Step 1: Google Dorking


- Using Google, can you identify who the Chief Executive Officer of Altoro Mutual is: CEO is Karl Fitzgerald

- How can this information be helpful to an attacker: An attacher can pose as Karl and email other employees asking for money, social engineering.


#### Step 2: DNS and Domain Discovery

Enter the IP address for `demo.testfire.net` into Domain Dossier and answer the following questions based on the results:

  1. Where is the company located: Sunnyvale, CA

  2. What is the NetRange IP address:65.61.137.64 - 65.61.137.127

  3. What is the company they use to store their infrastructure: Rackspace BackBone Engineering

  4. What is the IP address of the DNS server: 65.61.137.117

#### Step 3: Shodan

- What open ports and running services did Shodan find:
Ports 80. 443. 8080, 8443

services - Apache Tomcat/Coyote JSP engine version 1.1 -80
Apache Tomcat/Coyote JSP engine version 1.1 -443
Apache Tomcat/Coyote JSP engine version 1.1 - 8080
Apache Tomcat/Coyote JSP engine version 1.1 - 8443 

#### Step 4: Recon-ng

- Install the Recon module `xssed`. 
- Set the source to `demo.testfire.net`. 
- Run the module. 

Is Altoro Mutual vulnerable to XSS: 

Yes because we see in the output of the scan that there is 1 vulnerabilities; xssed. and the status is unfixed.

### Step 5: Zenmap

Your client has asked that you help identify any vulnerabilities with their file-sharing server. Using the Metasploitable machine to act as your client's server, complete the following:

- Command for Zenmap to run a service scan against the Metasploitable machine: nmap -sV 192.168.0.8
 
- Bonus command to output results into a new text file named `zenmapscan.txt`:nmap -sV -oN zenmapscan.txt --script smb-enum-shares 192.168.0.8

- Zenmap vulnerability script command:nmap -sV -oN zenmapscan.txt --script smb-enum-shares 192.168.0.8

- Once you have identified this vulnerability, answer the following questions for your client:
  1. What is the vulnerability: port 22 is vulnerable because it is open.

  2. Why is it dangerous: a hacker could access company files via using port 22 as a backdoor. they could also modify port 22 to filter traffic.

  3. What mitigation strategies can you recommend for the client to protect their server:  use the most up-to-date security patches as well as antivirus software.
